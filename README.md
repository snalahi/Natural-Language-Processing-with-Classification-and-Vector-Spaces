Vocabulary - Collection of unique words appeared in a corpus.

Corpus - A collection of written texts, especially the entire works of a particular author or a body of writing on a particular subject. In linguistics and NLP, corpus (literally Latin for body) refers to a collection of texts. Such collections may be formed of a single language of texts, or can span multiple languages -- there are numerous reasons for which multilingual corpora (the plural of corpus) may be useful.

In word frequency analysis in a corpus, there will be a dictionary mapping where each word along with its class (positive(1)/negative(2)) will be mapped to its frequency (number of appearance).

Instead of learning V dimensions of features, we can just learn 3 dimensions of features and that is in the form of [bias(1), sum of positive frequencies, sum of negative frequencies]
